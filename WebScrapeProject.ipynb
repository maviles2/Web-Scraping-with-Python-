    "For my final project, I decided to practice the skill of scraping a webpage \"dealnews\". This webpage was created for the sole purpose of providing its users with top daily online deals. Dealnews.com gives the user the option of looking at thousands of products on the web and ironically gathers its data via scraping pages. The process of this final project is divided into three significant subdivisions, which include connecting to the webpage, identifying what to scrape, and storing the data. During this process, the most challenging phase was determining how to scrape the desired elements in the webpage properly. Selecting the correct class and finding the proper ways to manipulate the output text from the webpage was the most challenging yet enjoyable part of this project. During this phase data, transformation techniques were applied to create a more legible data set. The dataset extracted data from this webpage to gather data such as the product type (p_type), the store Information were the product is being sold (store_name), and finally, the daily deal price of the product (price). \n",
    "Being able to scrape a webpage is a vital skill for a data scientist to possess, as we are currently in a technological realm where data is rapidly available online. A data scientist working for a company like Honey, which automatically applies online coupons to an eCommerce website, can undoubtedly expect to engage in web scraping (Honey, 2019). \n",
